# Node Spotify API

A simple to use API library for the Spotify REST API.
Only supports searching for tracks|albums|artists however the 2 former ones have not been tested. 

# What's Different?
* Uses ``node-fetch`` instead of ``request-promise`` (1 dependency instead of x).
* The code base has been completely rewritten and halved.
* Code is much easier to read and doesn't use weird mixtures of Promises and async/await.
* Returns the same results, a drop-in replacement with options (some missing as of the initial release).
* Added in a copy of the [ISC LICENSE](./LICENSE) based on the package.json 

# Installation

``npm i khafradev/node-spotify-api``

# API

Currently there is one method, ``search``. üîç

# Example

```js
const { Spotify } = require('node-spotify-api');

const SpotifyClient = new Spotify({
    id: 'client id',
    secret: 'client secret'
});

// later on ...
await SpotifyClient.search({ type: 'track', query: 'I Me Mine' });
await SpotifyClient.search({ type: 'album', query: 'Let It Be' });
await SpotifyClient.search({ type: 'artist', query: 'The Beatles' });
```

# Search

``search`` is the EASIEST way to find an artist, album, or track.
Neither artist or album have been tested with this fork.

```js
<SpotifyClient>.search({ type: 'artist|album|track', query: 'My search query' });
```

# Usage with Promises/Callbacks
* This package only supports Promises or async/await.
* Use [Util.callbackify](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_callbackify_original) to use with callbacks (but why?).
